# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will use the [USA Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vedavyasv/usa-housing) 
to predict the prices of houses in Boston. To keep things simple for this tutorial we won't use 
Jupyter Notebooks. Instead, we write just simple Python code.

We will use the dataset to train some machine learning models. All processed data and all experiments
should be tracked in ML Aide. We also want to store the trained models in ML Aide for later usage.

To get started we need some initial work to be done.
